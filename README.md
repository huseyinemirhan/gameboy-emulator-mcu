Nintendo Gameboy DMG-01 System Emulation on STM32F103(Blue Pill) and Raspberry Pi Pico 2

While this project first started to be run on a Blue Pill I soon realized that its specs would be hard to work with.
However the first version of the emulator will still work on STM32 however it will only be able to run GB games that don't require an external RAM or ROM banks.
The second version will be able to play most GB games(hopefully) however with the caveat of using a SD card for external ROM and RAM(which is the part that might be problematic)
In the third and final version I will port the emulator to Pico 2, which I hope will only involve me changing peripheral communications, and try to have a all around GB emulator.
All the versions will be available here in the future.
